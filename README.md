# Signal Processing Project

This project demonstrates the implementation and analysis of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques using both C and MATLAB. It includes both serial computation and a report detailing the results and methodology.

## Description

- `main.c`: Contains the C implementation of a signal processing algorithm, likely focused on performing FFT operations or related transformations.
- `serialfft.m`: A MATLAB script that computes the FFT of a signal in serial. Useful for verifying correctness or demonstrating theoretical behavior.
- `rxk4931_Final project Report.docx`: Report explaining the implementation, methodology, and results of the FFT analysis and experiments.

---

## Requirements

- C Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- MATLAB or GNU Octave for running `.m` scripts

---

## How to Run

**For C Program:**
```bash
gcc main.c -o fft_program
./fft_program
```

**For MATLAB Script:**
Open MATLAB and run:
```matlab
serialfft
```
